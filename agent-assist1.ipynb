What languages is the SDK available in?\nhelpful_assistant > The Agent Development Kit (ADK) from Google is an open-source, flexible, and modular framework designed to simplify the development and deployment of AI agents and multi-agent systems. It aims to make agent development more akin to traditional software development by providing a structured way to build, orchestrate, and evaluate agents powered by large language models (LLMs).\n\nKey aspects of the ADK include:\n*   **Purpose:** It allows developers to define agent behavior, orchestration, and tool usage directly in code, offering fine-grained control and enabling robust debugging, versioning, and deployment across various environments, from local machines to the cloud.\n*   **Flexibility:** While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, meaning it can work with different LLMs (such as Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude, and Mistral via LiteLLM) and be deployed to various infrastructures like Vertex AI Agent Engine, Cloud Run, or Docker.\n*   **Features:** It supports multi-agent architectures, allowing developers to build modular and scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents. ADK also provides a rich tool ecosystem, enabling agents to use pre-built tools (like Google Search), custom functions, or integrate third-party libraries. It includes built-in evaluation capabilities, a development UI for testing and debugging, and support for real-time interaction through bidirectional audio/video streaming.\n\nThe Agent Development Kit (ADK) is available in the following programming languages:\n*   Python\n*   Java\n*   Go\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":95},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!adk create Ai-agent --model gemini-2.5-flash-lite --api_key $GOOGLE_API_KEY","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"url_prefix = get_adk_proxy_url()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-18T19:57:28.247008Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-18T19:57:28.247308Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-18T19:57:28.254794Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-18T19:57:28.247287Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-18T19:57:28.253545Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.HTML object>","text/html":"\n    <div style=\"padding: 15px; border: 2px solid #f0ad4e; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #fef9f0; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <div style=\"font-family: sans-serif; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #333; font-size: 1.1em;\">\n            <strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Action Required</strong>\n        </div>\n        <div style=\"font-family: sans-serif; margin-bottom: 15px; color: #333; line-height: 1.5;\">\n            The ADK web UI is <strong>not running yet</strong>.
